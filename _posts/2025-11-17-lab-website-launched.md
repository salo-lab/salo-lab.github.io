Today marks the first steps in building the Salo Lab website. The pages, layout,
and structure are starting to come together — from the research overview to the
team section and the first design elements for our visual identity. Much more
will be added as the lab grows, but it’s exciting to see the foundation take
shape.

Stay tuned for updates as we prepare for the official launch of the lab in 2026!
