# {% include icon.html icon="fa-solid fa-people-group" %} Lab Values

Our lab is built on clear principles that guide how we work together, how we do science, and how we support each other’s long-term growth.

## How we work

- **Kindness.** Treat everyone with respect. Be honest, share openly, support each other. No superstars — we work toward common goals.

- **Curiosity.** Build models, test them, and focus on the mechanistic questions that matter. Data alone isn’t the goal; understanding is.

- **Enthusiasm.** Learn the methods the project truly needs. Be willing to try new approaches, change direction, and avoid getting stuck on one experiment.

- **Creativity.** Develop methods when driven by real questions. Connect distant ideas or classical techniques to find the best path forward.

- **Collaboration.** Share data early, discuss problems openly, cross-train, and collaborate widely across disciplines and labs.

- **Rigor.** Strong experimental design, good controls, careful quantification, and honest interpretation. Models evolve — refinement is part of the process.

- **Mentorship.** I guide without micromanaging. My commitment is to each trainee’s long-term growth and career trajectory, not only the next paper.

- **Sustainability.** We aim for science that is sustainable both for people and for the planet. We work in ways that minimize unnecessary waste, use resources responsibly, and recognize that long-term scientific success requires long-term human well-being.
