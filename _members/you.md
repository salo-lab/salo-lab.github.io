We are recruiting!

If you are excited about lipid flux, membrane dynamics, or in-cell structural
biology and cryo-ET, consider joining the Salo Lab.

Positions for postdocs, PhD students, and master’s students will open as the lab
launches in 2026 at Karolinska Institutet and the University of Helsinki.

Interested candidates are warmly encouraged to contact Veijo.
