Fatima completed her PhD at the University of Helsinki, where she studied how peroxisomes are formed and maintained in mammalian cells, with particular focus on the role of RRBP1. Her work addressed how organelles communicate and how subtle changes in cellular organization influence metabolic homeostasis.

Fatima is currently investigating lipid biology and organelle dynamics in the Salo lab. Her research focuses on how lipid droplets, endoplasmic reticulum contact sites, and metabolic pathways coordinate to shape cellular function. By combining quantitative cell biology with collaborative approaches, she aims to uncover principles linking membrane organization to metabolic regulation and disease.

Outside the lab, Fatima enjoys travelling, exploring new places, and spending time with family and friends.
