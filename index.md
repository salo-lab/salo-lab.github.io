# Our mission

To unravel how lipid flux shapes cellular architecture. We do this via advanced cell and in-cell structural biology at nanoscale resolution...

## Highlights

{% capture text %}
We study how organelles form, remodel, and coordinate metabolic decisions, using cryo-CLEM, cryo-ET, and live-cell imaging approaches.
